## Data Sources

- **COVID-19 Historical Data for Charts**: The application uses the endpoint `[https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/all?lastdays=all](https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/all?lastdays=all)` to fetch historical COVID-19 data. This data is used to populate charts that display the progression of cases over time.
  
- **COVID-19 Country Data for Map**: The application uses the endpoint `[https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries](https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries)` to fetch current COVID-19 data by country. This data is used to display information on the map, showing the impact of the pandemic across different regions.

## Features
- **Zod for Form Validation**: Ensures that all user inputs are validated against defined schemas, providing robust form handling and error reporting.
- **Toastify for Messaging**: Implements toast notifications for user-friendly, real-time feedback on form submissions and other actions within the app.
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimizes performance by loading components only when they are needed, improving the initial load time of the application.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling across the app, ensuring that any issues are caught and presented to the user in a clear and understandable way.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI that works seamlessly across all devices, providing a consistent user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Component Reusability**: The application is built with reusable components, making the codebase more maintainable and reducing redundancy.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Chart Data Handling**: Improve the way data is managed for the x-axis and y-axis in charts, allowing for better accuracy and flexibility. Additionally, enhance the tooltip functionality for a more informative and user-friendly experience.
- **Dynamic Map Boundaries**: Implement a feature to dynamically adjust the max bounds of the map based on the data displayed, ensuring that the map view is always optimal.
- **Local State Persistence**: Integrate Redux Persist to store state values locally, allowing for a more seamless user experience by maintaining state across sessions.
